#THIS REPO IS ***SCRATCH*** WORK#
This repo is scratch work for playing with some opencv functionaliy. 

It is 
- NOT neatly organized 
- NOT properly commented for other developers to follow
- NOT guaranteed in any way whatsoever.
It is ***scratch*** work.


Helpful info for compiling:
`g++ scratch.cpp -o scratch -I/usr/local/include/opencv4 -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_imgcodecs`

Eventually lessons learned here will be put into a neatly orgnized and properly 
commented project, but for now it is just for playing around with opencv 
funcationality and for educational purposes.
